# Watopoly

This is a modified version of Monoply, based on the University of Waterloo campus, and hence renamed Watopoly. I have implemented this code using C++ and the basic Object Oriented Programming principles. 

The main components of the game are:

    1. Board
    2. Blocks
    3. Players
    4. Property squares
    5. Non-property squares
    6. Special features
